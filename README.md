# 🎮 Player Engagement Prediction

A beginner-friendly machine learning project that predicts player engagement levels — **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** — using a **Random Forest Classifier**.  
This project demonstrates basic data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a simple model that helps identify how engaged players are based on their gaming activity and demographic features.

---

## ✅ Results

- **Accuracy:** 89%  
- **Macro F1-Score:** 0.89  

The model performs consistently across all engagement categories.

---

## 🧠 Steps Overview

1. **Data Exploration** – Understand the dataset and clean missing values.  
2. **Preprocessing** – Encode categorical variables.  
3. **Model Training** – Use a Random Forest Classifier.  
4. **Evaluation** – Test on unseen data for accuracy and F1-score.
